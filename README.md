# Simple-Translator-App
My Initial try to use ML-KIT Model by Google for Translation.

For ML-KIT Documentations Visit : https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/translation/android

Guidance for Implementation visit (Kotlin) : https://c1ctech.com/translate-text-with-ml-kit-on-android/

The Guidance is in Kotlin but i have recoded and implemented in Java.

Had Fun Trying Something new.
